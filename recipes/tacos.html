    <p>White People Tacos are a staple of caucasian families all over the United States. Introduced in the seventies from America's favorite resturant chain, Taco Bell, WPT are an excellent source of protein, carbs y un pocito spice (bueno).</p>
    <p>I remember, growing up in the slums of the North Shore, my parents would make WPT as a celebration for my siblings and I. Such occasions including wining our high school track meets or demolishing the neighborhood children in Yu Gi Oh.</p>
